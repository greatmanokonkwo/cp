# The Competitive Programming Training Session

## Starting off

1. Read chapter in book "The Competitive Programmer's Handbook"
2. Understand and implement all algorithms in the chapter
3. Solve problems related that topic in Skiena's book (At least 3 problems)
4. Read any related material in Skiena's book that you might need to solve the problems
5. Solve leetcode problems on specific topic (2 easy, 3 medium, 2 hard at least)
6. Fully read Skiena's chapter on topic and solve rest of problems
7. Rinse and repeat

## After mastered concepts

1. Do a CCC Online Grader contests
2. Do leetcodes
3. Solve any unfinished Skiena problems
4. Codeforces competitions
